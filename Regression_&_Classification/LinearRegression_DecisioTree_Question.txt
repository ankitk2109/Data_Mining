Question 1: Simple linear regression
The file ./specs/MarkA question1.csv contains data about midterm and final
term grades for a group of students.
• Plot the data using matplotlib. Do midterm and final seem to have a
linear relationship? Save your plot to ./output/marks.png
• Use linear regression to generate a model for the prediction of a students
final exam grade based on the students midterm grade in the course. Describe the model in your report.
• According to your model, what will be the final exam grade of a student
who received an 86 on the midterm exam?


Question 2: Classification with Decision Tree
The file ./specs/borrower question2.csv contains bank data about customers
that may or may not be borrowers.
• Filter out the TID attribute, as it is not useful for decision making.
• Using sklearn decision trees, generate a decision tree using information gain as splitting criterion, and a minimum impurity decrease of 0.5.
Leave everything else to its default value. Plot the resulting decision
tree, and discuss the classification results. Save the produced tree into
./output/tree high.png
• Train another tree, but this time use a minimum impurity decrease of 0.1.
Plot the resulting decision tree, and compare the results with the previous
model you trained. Save the produced tree into ./output/tree low.png
